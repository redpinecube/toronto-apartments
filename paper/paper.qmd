abstract: "Canada's rapidly aging population brings a spotlight onto the issue of accessible housing. The cost of making homes accessible can be expensive but there is a caveat, only low rise homes such as town homes and detached homes are expensive to design or remodel. High rise apartments on the other hand are different the costs are minimal. However, data on Toronto apartments from Open Data Toronto was used to find that there are barely any accessible units. Toronto apartments seem to have an all or nothing mentality. Some apartments have units that are all accessible while most have no accessible units at all."
