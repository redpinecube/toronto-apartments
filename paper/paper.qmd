abstract: "Demand for accessible Canadian housing has risen in the past decade as the average Canadian age has increased. Data from Open Data Toronto was used to discern that supply is stagnant. Around 10% of all units are accessible with most of these units residing in the wards Humber River-Black Creek and Don Valley East. The percentage of accessible units within a building follows a bimodal distribution with most appartments having no accessible units and some having full accessibilty."
